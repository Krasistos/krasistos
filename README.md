## 🔧 Active Projects

### [Selling Website](https://github.com/krasistos/selling-website)  
A project I’m building for a friend who wants to launch a **sticker selling business**. I'm using **ASP.NET Core** to refresh my skills with C# and web development.

### [School Website](https://github.com/krasistos/schoolwebsite)  
This is a school project where I built a **website using PHP and React**. The server-side (Express) was written by me, and the front-end was developed in collaboration with a friend. The project was originally hosted on **Render**, but we later migrated it to **SuperHosting.bg** (PHP-only hosting). I’m still working on the **admin panel** to allow non-technical users to manage content.

### Minimaarket System  
This is a **diploma project** for a **minimarket system**. I’m implementing **React** for the front-end and **Supabase** (with S3 bucket for file storage), **Prisma** for the back-end, and **Swagger** for API documentation. This project is helping me learn how to build full-stack applications.

## 💻 Coding Challenge Achievements

I’m also passionate about solving coding challenges.  
Currently, I’m solving challenges on **Codewars** and have achieved **4 kyu** in **C#**, **JavaScript**, and some **C** challenges. I’m always excited to improve my problem-solving skills and learn new algorithms!

## 🌱 What’s Next?

- Finish building my **Minimarket System** and improve the admin panel for the **School Website**.
- Continue solving more coding challenges and expanding my problem-solving abilities.
- Help a friend from **FMI** with his **similar diploma project**.
- **Explore low-level programming** and **systems programming** more deeply.
- **Pursue Computer Science (CS)** at **FMI** to build a solid foundation in algorithms, data structures, and low-level systems.
